            Motorcycling is the act of riding a motorcycle, a two-wheeled motor vehicle that serves various purposes, from commuting and leisure riding to competitive sports like motocross and road racing. There are several types of motorcycles, including cruisers, known for their relaxed riding position; sportbikes, designed for speed and agility; touring bikes, built for long-distance travel with added comfort; and dirt bikes, which are lightweight and suitable for off-road use. Safety is a crucial aspect of motorcycling, with riders typically donning helmets, gloves, jackets, and protective gear to minimize the risk of injury.
